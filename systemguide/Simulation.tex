\chapter{Simulation}
This class begins performing the simulation by creating the voting precincts from the input file, and calling the RunSimulationPct function for each precinct.

\section{ReadPrecincts}
Using a reference to the scanner reading from the input file, this function generates instances of OnePct and calls ReadData for that precinct, to populate it's member variables with values.
This continues until the scanner stops providing input.  These precints are stored in the pcts\_ map.

\section{RunSimulation}
This function iterates through the pcts\_ map, and, if the precinct has an appropriate number of voters for the simulation, calls \texttt{RunSimulationPct} for that precinct.
