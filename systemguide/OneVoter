\chapter{OneVoter}
The OneVoter class is used to represent a single voter to be used in the voting simulation.  

\section{Constructor}
The Constructor for the OneVoter class takes in three integers as parameters.  These integers assign values to the Voter's sequence_,time_arrival_seconds_, and time_vote_duration_seconds_ variables.  The Time_Start_voting_seconds_ and which_station variables are set to default values 0 and -1 by the constructor.

\section{General Functions}

\subsection{AssignStation}
\begin{description}
\item[Parameters] int station_number, int start_time_seconds
\item[Returns] void
\item[Usage] This function takes in station_number and Start_time_seconds, and uses the data to calculate which station the voter will use, total time spent voting, and total time spent waiting to vote.
\end{description}

\subsection{GetTimeDoneVoting}
\begin{description}
\item[Parameters] none
\item[Returns] returns the time spent voting as int
\item[Usage] calculates time spent voting by adding time_start_voting_seconds_ and time_vote_duration_seconds_.
\end{description}

\subsection{GetTimeInQ}
\begin{description}
\item[Parameters] none
\item[Returns] returns time spent in voting que as int
\item[Usage] calculates time spent in the voting que for a single voter by subtracting time_arrival_seconds_ from time_start_voting_seconds_.
\end{description}

\subsection{GetTOD}
\begin{description}
\item[Parameters] int time_in_seconds
\item[Returns] Returns the time of day that a voter voted as a string.
\item[Usage] Uses time_in_seconds and offset_hours to calculate when the voting took place.
\end{description}

\subsection{ConvertTime}
\begin{description}
\item[Parameters] int time_in_seconds
\item[Returns] returns a time as a string
\item[Usage] ues time in seconds to calculate time with hours, minutes, and seconds.  This function is called by GetTOD.
\end{description}

\subsection{ToString}
\begin{description}
\item[Usage] Standard ToString function for an instance of OneVoter.
\end{description}

\subsection{int time_in_seconds}
\begin{description}
\item[Usage] Returns a string of shortened variable names to act as a header for a table of voter data.
\end{description}

\section{Private Variables}

\begin{description}
\item[int sequence] Voters place in the que of voters.
\item[int time_arrival_seconds_] Time voter arrived at polling station after station opened.
\item[int time_done_voting_seconds_] Time the voter has completed voting process.
\item[int time_start_voting_seconds_] The time a voter begins the voting process.
\item[int time_vote_duration_seconds_] Time a voter spends voting.
\item[int time_waiting_seconds_] Time a voter spends waiting to vote.
\item[int which_station_] The voting station at which a voter votes.
\end{description}
