\chapter{Main}
This is the entry point in the Voting Simulation program. It is not a true class.

Main is responsible for gathering input and checking that arguments passed in are of the correct type.  Main also opens the Utils log file before passing execution to the Simulation class.

Main does not contain any member functions or variables.

Main supplies input data to the configuration class and the MyRandom class, and passes data to the Simulation class that will be used to create the voting precincts.

Once Input files have been properly handles, an instance of the Simulation class is created, and RunSimulation is called for that instance of simulation.
