## Suggested Reading

### [Git Textbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

It is essential that  you go through [1.6 Getting Started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) in order to be able to use Git.

Familiarize yourself with [3. Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) and [5.2 Contributing to a Project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project). For your convenience, [2. Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) is also recomended.

### [Git Cheat Sheet](https://www.linux.com/learn/your-real-world-git-cheat-sheet)

This is intended as a quick reference, not a substitute for the text. If you're short on time, though, it will suffice as a substitute for the text as well.

### [Chromium Source Code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master)

Don't read the entire Chromium Source Code; it's just a good style example to go by if you've been having difficulty with documentation or style.

For a specific example, see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/net/socket/socket.h

## Contributing 

You must fork the Repository onto your own Github Account and make the changes there. Commit frequently, e.g., every time you document a method or patch a bug. Submit a pull request to `master` on this repository only when you have completed the issue you are working on.

Since you are working on your own fork, you may modify your own `master` branch, but as a general rule, changes should only be made to one's `master` branch when they are ready to deploy.

When you start work on a task, assign yourself to the associated issue. If there is no associated issue, make one and assign the issue to the appropriate milestone first.

Documentation should be placed in `.h` and `.cc` files. The documentation in `.h` files should detail what each function does and what the class does overall. Documentation in `.cc` files should be concerned with the implementation details.
